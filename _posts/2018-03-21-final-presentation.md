Final presentation: Meltdown & Spectre

For my final project, I recorded a 30-minute talk about [Meltdown][] and [Spectre][]:
background, impact & mitigation, followed by a brief explanation of how the Spectre attack works.

[Meltdown]: https://meltdownattack.com/
[Spectre]: https://spectreattack.com/

You can also watch it on the Internet Archive: <https://archive.org/details/MeltdownAndSpectre>.

\[Note from 2019: some of the advice given in this talk is already outdated — attacks have improved (as predicted) and [new attacks][cpufail] have been discovered.
Still, the rest of the talk is solid — it provides a good historical context of the bugs, how they were disclosed, and how the community reacted.
And the technical explanation is a good intro to how these sort of hardware bugs can be exploited. \]
