Week 2: Forensics
=================

This week we dip our toes into _forensics_!
I'll start by covering some basic concepts and then we'll use those concepts to analyzze a USB stick.

THINGS TO COVER
impartiality
volatility heirachy

First things first
------------------

Impartiality
------------

When investigating


Locard's exchange principle
---------------------------


Locard’s exchange principle:

> Every interaction leaves evidence.


Dr. Edmond Locard was a French criminologist who lived roughly a century ago.
I'm paraphrasing because the original quote was in French and I can't find an
original source.

This is (apparently) the underlying principle of all modern forensics.

I'm slightly skeptical of this principle when it comes to computers,
but as we'll see in the rest of this post, there are plenty of cases where it applies.

Corollary: since the investigator has to interact with things to investigate them,
the investigator also leaves evidence. Thus, one of your most important duties as a
forensics investigator is to document every single action you take in the course of an
investigation, so that clean evidence can be separated out from compromised evidence.

We can also read Locard's principle as
a reforumulation of the observer effect in quantum mechanics.
Whoaaaaaaaa.

Volatility
----------

The general rule for beginning a forensic investigation is to
_collect the most volatile data first_.

It turns out there's a fscking RFC for this: [RFC3227][],
published Feb 2002.

[RFC3227]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3227

1. memory
2. hibernation file
3. temp files
4. process tables, network connections
5. network routing info, arp cache

    a. it is now safe to turn off your computer

That covers the stuff that won't persist across a reboot.
Continuing with less volatile state we have:

6. disks (with forensic tools, write blocker)
7. remote logging (cameras)
8. physical configuration & network topology
9. backups
    a. caveat: tape backups are very time consuming to work with


Volatility (redux)
------------------

Let's talk about memory dumps.
There is a handy open source tool for analyzing memory dumps which,
just to make things confusing,
is also called [volatility][].

I'm going to briefly explain the bits that we went over in class.
If you want to learn more you are welcome to read the [documentation][]
or the [cheat sheet][].


[volatility]: http://www.volatilityfoundation.org/
[documentation]: https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki
[cheat sheet]: https://downloads.volatilityfoundation.org//releases/2.4/CheatSheet_v2.4.pdf


1. `volatility -f memory_dump.mem imageinfo`

First and foremost, if you find yourself in posession of a strange memory dump,
the first thing you'll want to do is run `imageinfo` on it to find out what kind of system it's from. This will spit out something like `suggested profiles: WinSP0x86`. Copy that string into the rest of these commands.

2. `volatility -f memory_dump.mem --profile=WinSP0x86 psscan`

`psscan` prints a list of proceses that were running at the time of the memory dump.

3. `volatility -f memory_dump.mem --profile=WinSP0x86 dlllist -p 1234`

Given a process ID, `dlllist` will tell you what DLLs a process had loaded.

4. `volalility -f memory_dump.mem --profile=WinSP0x86 mftparser`

This is a cool one. It reads the master file table block to
give you a list of the files on the filesystem.
(What's the MFT doing in a memory dump? It must be cached in memory somewhere.)

5. `volatility -f memory_dump.mem --profile=WinSP0x86 timeliner --output=dump`

This is another cool one. `timeliner` prints out a timeline of everything that happend on the system (everything still in memory, anyway). Running processes, filesystem events, etc. It's all here.

### Aside: making memory dumps

There are several tools for capturing memory dumps.
In class, the tool we used was [FTK Imager][].

Bear in mind that the very act of running a memory dumper affect the memory of the system —
the memory dumper will show up in the process list in the dump.

When capturing a memory dump, do not write it to hard disk of the system you're
dumping. Dump to an external hard drive. We'll be capturing the disk image next.


Data recovery
-------------

That covers recovering data from memory, but what about data from disk?

* buy a write blocker device
* image the disk with FTK im



toolkit: write-protected cdrom or usb stick
never ever install tools on a suspect machine - compromised evidence

If you're even slightly computer-saavy, you probably know that when you delete a file,
the file doesn't disappear right away. The inode in the file system is removed, but the contents of the file linger around on the disk in unused blocks.

The act of looking at unused blocks on a disk and piecing together deleted files from them
is known as "carving". Don't ask me why.

The tool we used in class was [PhotoRec][], which is free, open source (GPLv2), and cross-platform.

[PhotoRec]: https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec

We'll see PhotoRec in action in the next section, so I won't say much about it just yet.



Tips
----

1. Write everything down. Document everything.
Note down what time you did everything.


The Challenge
-------------

We were given a challenge in class to investigate a dump of a USB drive.



Mon Jan 22nd,

Analyzed usb image data with volatility
Volatility imageinfo didn’t recognize anything - makes sense, since we are told this is a disk dump rather than a memory dump. (took 5m)

Let’s mount with osfmounter
17:09 used osfmount to mount image as drive E: (read-only)

there are 6 files, mostly with korean-looknig names
an .mp3, a jpg, a png, a bin, a bat, and a zip

we’re going to ignore these for now and try to recover deleted files with photorec

17:15 photorec recovered 8 files. viewed the images

this isn’t leading anywhere

tried to open zip on the drive, password protected

https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/around-the-world-in-ip-attacks/
“DuBrute is a service that processes three text files in sequence: IP addresses, login names, and then passwords. Once running, it fires off logins and passwords until it exhausts the first IP address and repeats the process on down list one until the end. Cute and nasty.”

there was also a hosts lists. someone was trying to brute-force a bunch of hosts

17:26 opened “fdd” in fileInsight. It’s an elf executable

17:31 mounted the .apple file and ran photorec on it. no dice

17:35 watched the video. it shows someone investigating a piece of malware in “RAPTOR” - some sort of network/threat monitoring software
a quick google doesn’t reveal any products under that name
