Week 2: Forensics
=================

This week we dip our toes into _forensics_!
I'll start by covering some basic concepts and then we'll use those concepts to analyzze a USB stick.

Volatility
----------

The general rule for beginning a forensic investigation is to _collect the most volatile data first_.

It turns out there's a fscking RFC for this: [RFC3227][].

Published Feb 2002.

[RFC3227]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3227

1. memory
2. hibernation file
3. temp files
4. process tables, network connections
5. network routing info, arp cache
    a. it is now safe to turn off your computer
6. disks (with forensic tools, write blocker)
7. remote logging (cameras)
8. physical configuration & network topology
9. backups
    a. caveat: tape backups are very time consuming to work with


There's also a tool called volatility for analyzing memory dumps.

    "The Volatility Framework is open source and written in Python."

Tips
----

1. Write everything down. Document everything.
Note down what time you did everything.


The Challenge
-------------

We were given a challenge in class to investigate a dump of a USB drive.
